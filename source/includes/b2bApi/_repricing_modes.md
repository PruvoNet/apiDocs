# Repricing Modes

## Automatic

Once a better rate is found for a monitored reservation, Pruvo will automatically re-book and notify your back office on the 
made changes (using your back office update endpoint).

## Semi Automatic

Once a better rate is found for a monitored reservation, Pruvo will notify the assigned agent by email and require 
their verification prior to the one click re-booking process.
