# Authorization

This section describes the authorization process.

Every request to any available endpoint requires authorization. To get the authorization credentials you need an active partner account registered within Pruvoâ€™s systems.

The following table details the required headers that must be sent with each request.

Header key | Header value | Description | Example
---------- | ------- | ------- | ------- 
`Authorization` | Authorization Key | Key provided by Pruvo | `bf93c4e2-36d6-413c-aa86-46c1b108215d`
`API-Version` | Api Version | PI Version to use | `1.0` 

If you prefer not to send the authorization data as headers, you can send them as query paramters:

Key | Value | Description | Example
---------- | ------- | ------- | ------- 
`access_token` | Authorization Key | Key provided by Pruvo | `bf93c4e2-36d6-413c-aa86-46c1b108215d`
`api_version` | Api Version | PI Version to use | `1.0`
